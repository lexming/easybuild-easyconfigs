description = """The General Lake Model (GLM) is a water balance and one-dimensional vertical
stratification hydrodynamic model, which is dynamically coupled with the AED
water quality modelling library. GLM-AED is suitable for simulating conditions
in a wide range of natural and engineered lakes, including shallow (well-mixed)
and deep (stratified) systems. The model has been successfully applied to
systems from the scale of individual ponds and wetlands, to actively operated
reservoirs, upto the scale of the Great Lakes."""
